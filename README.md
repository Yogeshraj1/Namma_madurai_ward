Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a smart, location-based portal using GIS and real-time data to provide ward mapping, civic issue reporting, and essential service access, fostering a well-connected and informed community.


Existing municipal resources lack interactive tools for issue reporting, Ward Splitting, service tracking, and community engagement.



Objectives
Use GPS coordinates to precisely identify the user's administrative ward. Remove the requirement for users to actively search for their ward information.

Real-time complaint tracking: to offer users with a clear update on the status of their complaints.

Rapid Alerts: Direct Communication between Ward Councillors and Residents
